# Gyx

The goal of this project is to explore the intrinsically distributed qualities of Elixir for implementing real world Reinforcement Learning environments. 

At this moment, this repository contains ad hoc implementations of environments and interacting agents. 
Initial abstractions are already stablished, so higher level programs like training procedures can seamesly be integrated with particular environment, agents, and learning strategies.




## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `gyx` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:gyx, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/gyx](https://hexdocs.pm/gyx).
